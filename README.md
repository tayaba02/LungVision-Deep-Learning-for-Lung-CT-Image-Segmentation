LungVision is a deep learning project designed to automate the segmentation of lung CT images, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lung disease diagnoses, including COVID-19. This project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to differentiate between lung tissue and other structures or anomalies within CT images, using pixel-level classification to produce segmented images that highlight lung areas. LungVision stands at the intersection of medical imaging technology and artificial intelligence, offering a powerful tool for radiologists and medical researchers.
